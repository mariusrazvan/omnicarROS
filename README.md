This project is helping me learn ROS2 and is based on this platform https://bit.ly/metalmecanum but with many changes.

Regarding movement, I changed the motors to https://bit.ly/jgb_37_520_12v_200rpm (no encoder) with a DFRobot controller board https://bit.ly/dfrobot_motor_controller and 4 meccanum wheels 80mm diameter.

Next upgrade was a Raspberry Pi IO expansion board https://bit.ly/4mRL2tw that is compatible and stackable with the previous one.
Short range IR proximity sensors were added for emergency stops, a frontal VL53L0X TOF Sensor https://bit.ly/4gWgZzr and a MPU6050 Sensor for distance and orientation.

All are controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4 and a RadioMaster Boxer ELRS Remote.

The purpose is to control the robot as far as possible with the ELRS remote or to switch to autonomous mode.

Please have patience as I barely have any time to work on this project.
